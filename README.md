# Recovery Intimation - Enterprise Debt Management CRM 🏦📱

An offline-first, high-performance Android application engineered for bank recovery agents and financial collection officers. Built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3), this CRM streamlines the debt recovery process through automated, tone-based SMS intimations.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Smart Hero-Centric Dashboard:** A clean, expressive UI that prioritizes critical data—Account Numbers and Overdue Amounts—for quick decision-making.
* **Intelligent Tone-Based SMS Automation:** An underlying logic engine calculates the proximity to the due date and generates context-aware messages:
  * 🟢 **Polite Tone:** For upcoming payments (1-3 days away).
  * 🟠 **Urgent Tone:** For payments due today.
  * 🔴 **Strict Tone:** For overdue accounts, emphasizing legal implications.
* **Guarantor Liability Pressure:** Automatically generates and queues secondary warning messages for loan guarantors, a critical strategy in banking recovery.
* **Zero-Cloud Architecture (Privacy First):** Built with a strict offline-first philosophy. All sensitive financial records (Borrower Details, Loan Amounts) are stored locally using **Room Database**. No data is uploaded to external servers.
* **Custom Bank Branding:** Allows agents to sign off messages with their specific institution's name (e.g., SBI, HDFC, J&K Bank).
